The ``Date`` Class
==================

Implement a single date class. First Let's answer simple questions below -

1. What defines a date? (Hint: Look at how you write a date)

2. What attributes do you think will be there on the date?

3. What methods will be there other than standard ``__init__`` method?

4. To answer this we'll need to answer some questions -
   a. Is 35th January 2011 a valid date?
   b. Is 31st September 2020 a valid date?
   c. Is 29th February 2020 a valid date?
   d. Does a given date belong to a leap year?


5. Write a 'better' date class -
   Think how you will organize the data - (Hint: Use built-in data structures)


6. Bonus points - given a date how to print the Day of the week corresponding to it?
   - Note: Do not take additional ``Day`` as a parameter.
   - This question is a bit involved. For some ``date`` a Day has to be given. Think
     about it.
