Python Object Oriented Features
===============================

The learning objective of this week is to learn Object oriented features of
Python. More specifically we will be looking at -

1. How to define a class

2. How to define attributes and methods inside a class

3. How to Create Objects using the class.

We will be looking at implementation of two basic classes -

1. ``Date`` Class (Python's standard library provides a nice date class, but
   we'll do something by hand mostly to understand how to define a class
   and create it's instances etc.

2. ``Division`` Class (A simple - almost trivial class but helps one learn
   basic syntax of a class.


We'll intentionally not get into some of the other object oriented features -
They can be learn once basic class and objects syntax is mastered.
